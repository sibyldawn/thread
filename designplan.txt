MVP
1. Use JSON Placeholder to have POSTS and COMMENTS.
2. UI with a list of Posts with titles.
3. When a post is clicked
4. It navigates to a Detailed Page Title and Content
5. From the detailed page, have the ability to go Back
6. Under the detailed post, I should see comments.
7. Each comment has to have a body,name, and email address.

Nice to have
1. Unit tests for core application features 
2. The ability to look up all posts by an author 
3.  A search filter to filter posts on the main screen
4. A comment field for users to submit a comment (may submit a POST to API and update the UI, but will not persist on API)
